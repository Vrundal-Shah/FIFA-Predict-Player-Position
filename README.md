# FIFA-Predict-Player-Position

## Intro
The purpose is to demonstrate our knowledge and comprehension of the data lifecycle by applying it to a real-world issue in this project. Our goal in this tutorial is to to appropriately classify soccer players into positional groups depending on their abilities and talents that are most valuable for different positions.

The sport of soccer has an estimated 4.0 billion followers (more than half of the worldâ€™s population) and brings in huge amounts of revenue in many places.

Statistical and data analysis in soccer has become more popular in recent years for a variety of reasons, including performance analysis, recruitment, and strategy. In this tutorial, we'll break down the many skill sets that players in various positions require to thrive, as well as examine whether or not players are being employed in their best place.

The use of data from the FIFA game, "FIFA 22", is made to gather the required information.
